                The Ruined King
            </h2>
            <p>
                Viego <br>
                <br>
                Once ruler of a long-lost kingdom, <br>
                Viego perished over a thousand years ago <br>
                when his attempt to bring his wife back <br>
                from the dead triggered the magical catastrophe <br>
                known as the Ruination. Transformed into a powerful, <br>
                unliving wraith tortured by an obsessive longing <br>
                for his centuries-dead queen, Viego now stands as <br>
                the Ruined King, controlling the deadly Harrowings <br>
                as he scours Runeterra for anything that might one <br>
                day restore her, and destroying all in his path as <br>
                the Black Mist pours endlessly from his cruel, broken heart.
            </p>

        <div class="box" id="box2">
            From Viego's perspective, everything is worth sacrificing <br> if it means bringing back his wife.
            This is a man who won't stop at anything <br> to not get what he wants, but needs. His beautiful wife, Isolde,
            was taken away early from him, <br> and Viego does not know how to stop his mission of vengance. He desperately
            searches all over the world for pieces of Isolde's soul to capture them and bring her back to life. One 
            by one he searches, growing more obsessive and crazy as time goes on. He slowly grows unrecognizable, 
            hurting and killing everyone in his way. Eventually, he is able to ressurect Isolde by collecting 
            all of her souls. Her spirit is revived, but only for a few minutes. Through this limited time, Isolde 
            is finally <br> able to speak to Viego directly. However, instead of showing her love and appreciation, she
            condemns him. She is gravely disappointed at what Viego has become, leaving Viego <br> stunned and heartbroken- 
            a moment of weakness. This moment of weakness is <br> what ultimately leads to Viego's downfall, allowing the 
            Sentinels of Light to capture him <br> and imprison him in the Shadow Isles forever. Still, Viego's perspective 
            remains the same; <br> nothing would cause him to take back all the damage he created if it meant <br> seeing Isolde one 
            last time.
