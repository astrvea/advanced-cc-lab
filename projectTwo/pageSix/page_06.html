                Lucian <br>
                <br>
                Lucian, a Sentinel of Light, is a grim hunter <br>
                of undying spirits, pursuing them relentlessly and <br>
                annihilating them with his twin relic pistols. <br>
                After the wraith Thresh slew his wife, Lucian embarked on
                the path of vengeanceâ€”but even with her return to life,
                his rage is undiminished. Merciless and single-minded,
                Lucian will stop at nothing to protect the living from the
                long-dead horrors of the Black Mist.

            From Viego's perspective, everything is worth sacrificing if it means <br> bringing back his wife.
            This is a man who won't stop at anything to not get what he wants, <br> but needs. His beautiful wife, Isolde,
            was taken away early from him, and Viego does not know how to stop his <br> mission of vengance. He desperately
            searches all over the world for pieces of Isolde's soul to capture them and bring her back to <br> life. One 
            by one he searches, growing more obsessive and crazy as time goes on. He slowly grows unrecognizable, 
            hurting and killing everyone <br> in his way. Eventually, he is able to ressurect Isolde by collecting 
            all of her souls. Her spirit is revived, but only for a few minutes. Through this limited time, Isolde 
            is finally able to speak to Viego directly. However, instead of showing her love and appreciation, she
            condemns him. <br> She is gravely disappointed at what Viego has become, leaving Viego stunned and heartbroken- 
            a moment of weakness. <br> This moment of weakness is what ultimately leads to Viego's downfall, allowing the 
            Sentinels of Light to capture <br> him and imprison him in the Shadow Isles forever. Still, Viego's perspective 
            remains the same; <br> nothing would cause him to take back all the damage he created if it meant <br> seeing Isolde one 
            last time.
