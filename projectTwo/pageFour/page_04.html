                Thresh <br>
                <br>
                Sadistic and cunning, Thresh is an <br>
                ambitious and restless spirit of the Shadow Isles. <br>
                Once the custodian of countless arcane secrets, <br>
                he was undone by a power greater than life or death, and <br>
                now sustains himself by tormenting and breaking others <br>
                with slow, excruciating inventiveness. His victims <br>
                suffer far beyond their brief mortal coil as Thresh wreaks <br>
                agony upon their souls, imprisoning them in his unholy <br>
                lantern to torture for all eternity.

            From Thresh's perspective, he could care less about Viego's or the Sentinels of Light's <br> mission. 
            The only thing he is interested in is about what he himself stands to gain from Ruination. <br> Ever since
            the birth of the Shadow Isles, Thresh has been collecting souls in his lantern. One of the souls was
            Lucian's wife, Senna, <br> who has since been freed from the lantern after Lucian's journey to confront Thresh.
            Nevertheless, Senna's soul was one of many, with Thresh biding his time to collect as many as he can to 
            eventually take over the Shadow Isles. These souls give Thresh power; allowing him to become the powerful entity 
            he strives to be. However, Thresh's perspective remains unchaged; he will help whoever will let him get 
            what he wants. In Viego's case, Thresh led him to the Waters of Life, which brought upon Ruination 
            among the Shadow Isles. In Lucian's case, he allowed for Senna's escape because he knew that he would have 
            his victory in the future. Out of all the beings from the Shadow Isles, it is not Viego who should be feared most,
            but Thresh.
