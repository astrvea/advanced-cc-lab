                The Exile
            </h2>
            <p>
                Riven <br>
                <br>
                Once a swordmaster in the warhosts of Noxus, <br>
                Riven is an expatriate in a land she previously <br>
                tried to conquer. She rose through the ranks <br>
                on the strength of her conviction and brutal <br>
                efficiency, and was rewarded with a legendary <br>
                runic blade and a warband of her own. <br>
                However, on the Ionian front, Riven's faith in her <br>
                homeland was tested and broken. <br>
            </p> 
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="box2">
            From Riven's perspective, fighting the Ruination was
            about obtaining freedom. <br> She spent much of her life wrongly
            imprisoned in a Noxus jail cell, where she devised an escape plan <br> 
            but had no one to help. However, with the help of the Sentinels,
            she was finally able to escape; out of gratitude,
            she devoted herself to stopping the Ruination and joined
            forces with the people who saved her. Things quickly took
            a turn for the worse when the man who imprisoned her,
            Draven, became Ruined by the Black Mist and demanded
            them to fight for their freedom. <br> Resolved to keep her life, 
            Riven fought once again and finally obtained true freedom.
