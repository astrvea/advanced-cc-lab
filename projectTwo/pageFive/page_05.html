                Gwen <br>
                <br>
                A former doll transformed and brought to life <br>
                by magic, Gwen wields the very tools that once created her.
                She carries the weight of her maker's love with 
                every step, taking nothing for granted. At her command
                is the Hallowed Mist, an ancient and protective magic 
                that has blessed Gwen's scissors, needles, and sewing thread. <br>
                So much is new to her, but Gwen remains joyfully determined to
                fight for the good that survives in a broken world.

            </p>

                The Hallowed Seamstress
            </h2>

        <div class="box" id="box2">
            From Gwen's perspective, she saw how deeply and beautifully Isolde loved <br> Viego while she 
            was still alive. With Viego's wife, Isolde, as the seamstress who created Gwen, she tragically 
            passed away before her creation came to life. As Viego's power and reign grew and grew, Gwen was 
            brought to life. Taking upon her creator's tools, she knew that Viego had to be stopped. Gwen knew of
            Isolde's true feelings; Isolde wanted her love to mean something. She wanted her and Viego's love to 
            be celebrated by all, not the cause of ruin all throughout the world. Gwen knew how bad Viego's <br> obsession
            had become and she made it her mission to make sure that no other life would be ruined by him. Although 
            Gwen was from the Shadow Isles and created from Isolde herself, she stands with those hurt by Ruination. 
            Seeing all the destruction firsthand, she promises that she will do all that she can to protect others from 
            the chaos, with the life she was given by her maker's love.
