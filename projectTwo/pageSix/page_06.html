                Lucian <br>
                <br>
                Lucian, a Sentinel of Light, is a grim hunter <br>
                of undying spirits, pursuing them relentlessly and
                annihilating them with his twin relic pistols.
                After the wraith Thresh slew his wife, Lucian embarked on
                the path of vengeanceâ€”but even with her return to life,
                his rage is undiminished. Merciless and single-minded,
                Lucian will stop at nothing to protect the living from the
                long-dead horrors of the Black Mist.

                The Purifier

        <div class="box" id="box2">
            From Lucian's perspective, keeping Senna alive and safe after losing her 
            once before was all he wanted. <br> His love and devotion to Senna mirrors but opposes Viego,
            as the Ruination is precisely what could take her away from him again.
            Though he was used to either working alone or as a pair with just Senna,
            he knew that Viego's threat was now too big to handle alone; thus, 
            he set off to the old Sentinel of Lights Headquarters to find old wisdom and new allies. 
            As he followed the Black Mist into many battles and new locations, 
            Lucian stopped at nothing to ensure the 
            safety of his love and his life.
