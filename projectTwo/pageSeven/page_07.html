                The Exile

            <p>
                Riven <br>
                <br>
                Once a swordmaster in the warhosts of Noxus, <br>
                Riven is an expatriate in a land she previously <br>
                tried to conquer. She rose through the ranks <br>
                on the strength of her conviction and brutal <br>
                efficiency, and was rewarded with a legendary <br>
                runic blade and a warband of her own. <br>
                However, on the Ionian front, Riven's faith in her <br>
                homeland was tested and ultimately broken. <br>

            From Viego's perspective, everything is worth sacrificing if it means <br> bringing back his wife.
            This is a man who won't stop at anything to not get what he wants, <br> but needs. His beautiful wife, Isolde,
            was taken away early from him, and Viego does not know how to stop his <br> mission of vengance. He desperately
            searches all over the world for pieces of Isolde's soul to capture them and bring her back to <br> life. One 
            by one he searches, growing more obsessive and crazy as time goes on. He slowly grows unrecognizable, 
            hurting and killing everyone in his way. Eventually, he is able to ressurect Isolde by collecting 
            all of her souls. Her spirit is revived, but only for a few minutes. Through this limited time, Isolde 
            is finally able to speak to Viego directly. However, instead of showing her love and appreciation, she
            condemns him. She is gravely disappointed at what Viego has become, leaving Viego stunned and heartbroken- 
            a moment of weakness. <br> This moment of weakness is what ultimately leads to Viego's downfall, allowing the 
            Sentinels of Light to capture <br> him and imprison him in the Shadow Isles forever. Still, Viego's perspective 
            remains the same; <br> nothing would cause him to take back all the damage he created if it meant <br> seeing Isolde one 
            last time.
