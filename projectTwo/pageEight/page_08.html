                The Rogue Sentinel
            </h2>
            <p>
                Akshan <br>
                <br>
                Raising an eyebrow in the face of danger, <br>
                Akshan fights evil with dashing charisma, <br>
                righteous vengeance, and a conspicuous lack of shirts. <br>
                He is highly skilled in the art of stealth combat, <br>
                able to evade the eyes of his enemies and reappear when <br>
                they least expect him. With a keen sense of justice <br>
                and a legendary death-reversing weapon, he rights <br>
                the wrongs of Runeterra's many scoundrels while <br>
                living by his own moral code: “Don't be an ass.”

        <div class="box" id="box2">
            From Akshan's perspective, fighting was never about saving the world; <br>
            all he wanted was to resurrect his dead mentor with the power of 
            the fabled resurrection weapon, <br> the Absolver. However, with the pain
            and learnings of multiple failed attempts, Akshan realized that his
            mentor <br> would rather he join the Sentinels' cause and use the weapon for good.
            As he joined the Sentinels and aided their many fights, <br>
            he came to terms with his mentor's death and realized the good
            he was able to achieve. His pursuit of selflessness paid off in the end,
            as he used the Absolver to turn the tides of a critical fight.
            By killing Isolde, he ended up resurrecting Senna and Gwen, <br>
            thus weakening Viego and allowing for his eventual defeat.
